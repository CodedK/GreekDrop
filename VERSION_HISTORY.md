# Version History

## v2.0.0 - Major Bug Fixes & Architecture Overhaul

### üîß Critical Bug Fixes

- **Fixed GPU Detection Logic**: UI now correctly highlights active device (CPU/GPU) in green using real-time `torch.cuda.is_available()` detection instead of cached values
- **Fixed Export File Locations**: All save functions now display absolute file paths in console and UI with toast notifications
- **Fixed Drag & Drop Workflow**: Dropped files now properly load into transcription workflow with visual feedback
- **Added "Export All Formats" Option**: New "All" format saves .txt, .srt, and .vtt simultaneously
- **Fixed Output Folder Confusion**: Output directory clearly displayed in UI settings with full absolute paths shown

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

- **Modular Code Structure**: Split functionality into logical modules:
  - `utils/logger.py` - Comprehensive logging system
  - `utils/hardware.py` - Real-time hardware detection
  - `utils/file_utils.py` - Enhanced file operations with path validation
  - `logic/transcriber.py` - Extensible transcription engine
  - `logic/preload.py` - Improved model caching
  - `config/settings.py` - Centralized configuration management
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout with proper logging
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Improved concurrency and resource management

### üé® UI/UX Enhancements
